# blindSafe
This is a Windows 10 application that helps visually impaired users manage stalled or stopped Windows. That is, it helps an impaired user find the problem an destroy the application window, or to completely restart windows. Impaired users are unable to "see" many dialogs and other visual or graphical cues that something in wrong.

One project goal is to keep the application in a single executable that requires no configuration and installation is as simple coping an executable  file onto the users machine. The user may double-click on the application or create a short-cut to use the program.

### Getting Started - Users

A user navigates to URL foo an downloads the file xxxxxx.exe onto their local machine. You can then launch the application with the file explorer by double-clicking on it.
